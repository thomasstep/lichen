# lichen
Vim color scheme based on the colors of lichen.

Lichen is meant to be a dimmed color scheme for dark terminals and was created using the 256 colors. My goal of this color scheme was to make it easy to have nice looking syntax highlighting without having to install a ton of plugins.

If you have any suggestions on changing syntax coloring, please let me know. I mostly code in Node and Python, so those are the languages I focused on coloring for.

Below are screenshot examples of what lichen might look like using different languages.
